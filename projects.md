## Leveraging Active Learning for Labeling TREC Ad-hoc Data-set
### (Md Mustafizur Rahman, Matthew Lease)
[Dec, 2016 - Present]

- NIST evaluates relevance judgement only for a set of documents in a collection because the human evaluation is costly. The purpose of this project is to develop an active learning approach which will find out the fine-grained balance between the cost and the gold-dataset collection

[Aug, 2016 - Oct, 2016]

- In this project, we surveyed the current landscape of Neural Information Retrieval (IR) research, paying special attention to the use of learned representations of queries and documents (i.e., neural embeddings). We highlighted the successes of neural IR thus far, catalog obstacles to its wider adoption, and suggest potentially promising directions for future research.

## Designing of a Novel Ensemble Classifier for Time Series Forecasting

- In an ensemble classifier approach, multiple base classifiers learn decision boundaries on the training patterns, and their decisions on a test pattern are fused to reach the final classification verdict. Ensemble classifiers are also known as committee of classifiers, mixture of experts, and multiple classifier systems. Many ensemble classifier generation methods are presented in the literature. The generation methods aim to produce the base classifiers in a way that they differ from each other in terms of the errors they make on identical patterns. This phenomenon is also known as diversity. The fusion methods, on the other hand, explore ways to merge the decisions from the base classifiers into a final verdict. Our job was to design a novel ensemble classifier that is not only diverse but also accurate.
