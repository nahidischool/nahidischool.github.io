#### Applied Machine Learning Intern, Los Alamos National Laboratory, NM
[June, 2017 - August, 2017]

- Developed semi-supervised graph based regularization deep learning model that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data points
- Extracted clinical information from cancer pathology reports for automatic cancer type and site detection

## Attention-based Learning to Rank in Document Relevance Judgement   
#### Graduate Research Assistant, UT Austin
[Dec, 2016 - Present]   

- Developing an attention-based model to find out the important part of a document
- Utitlizing the rationale 

## Leveraging Active Learning for Labeling TREC Ad-hoc Data-set
#### Graduate Research Assistant, UT Austin
[Dec, 2016 - May, 2016]

- NIST evaluates relevance judgement only for a set of documents in a collection because human evaluation is costly. The purpose of this project is to develop an active learning approach which will find out the fine-grained balance between cost and gold-dataset collection

[Aug, 2016 - Oct, 2016]

- In this project, we surveyed the current landscape of Neural Information Retrieval (IR) research paying special attention to the use of learned representations of queries and documents (i.e., neural embeddings). We highlighted the successes of neural IR thus far. Then we cataloged obstacles to its wider adoption and finally, suggested potentially promising directions for future research.

- In an ensemble classifier approach, multiple base classifiers learn decision boundaries on the training patterns, and their decisions on a test pattern are fused to reach the final classification verdict. Ensemble classifiers are also known as committee of classifiers, mixture of experts, and multiple classifier systems. Many ensemble classifier generation methods are presented in the literature. The generation methods aim to produce the base classifiers in a way that they differ from each other in terms of the errors they make on identical patterns. This phenomenon is also known as diversity. The fusion methods, on the other hand, explore ways to merge the decisions from the base classifiers into a final verdict. Our goal was to design a novel ensemble classifier that is not only diverse but also accurate.
